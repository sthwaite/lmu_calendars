DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Prof. Dr. Christian Holm\n(Institut für Computerphys
 ik Universität Stuttgart)\n\nIn the last 20 years the importance of soft 
 condensed matter that encompasses polymers\, colloidal solutions\, liquid 
 crystals\, and biological matter\, has steadily increased. A specially imp
 ortant subclass is charged soft matter which includes polyelectrolytes\, p
 roteins\, DNA\, or charged stabilized colloidal solutions that we meet in 
 daily life in soaps\, food\, lipsticks or sanitary products\, just to name
  a few. Soft matter systems are normally large compared to quantum dimensi
 ons\, so that classical effective theories are sufficient to describe thei
 r behavior. However\, thermal motion and conformational entropy plays a la
 rge role and those effects need to be taken accurately into account in the
 ir modeling. Coarse-grained models are very successful to model the static
  behavior of soft matter systems\, however\, one needs to use mesoscopic s
 olvent model to describe dynamical effects. We will present recent develop
 ments to model the electrophoretic behavior of charged polymers and colloi
 ds and discuss the interesting case of DNA within a nanopore.\n\nhttp://ww
