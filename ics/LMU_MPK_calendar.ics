SUMMARY:Münchner Physik Kolloquium: The life-cycle of molecular clouds in

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Dr. Stefanie Walch\n(Max-Planck-Institut für Astroph
 ysik\, Garching)\n\nMolecular clouds are cold\, dense\, and turbulent fila
 mentary structures that condense out of the multi-phase interstellar mediu
 m. They are also the sites of star formation. The minority of new-born sta
 rs is massive\, but these stars are particularly important for the fate of
  their parental molecular clouds. I will present results from high- perfor
 mance\, three-dimensional simulations that show the formation and dispersa
 l of molecular clouds within representative pieces of disk galaxies. Apart
  from stellar feedback and self-gravity\, we employ an accurate descriptio
 n of gas heating and cooling as well as a small chemical network including
  molecule formation and self- shielding. Gravitational collapse is compens
 ated by stellar feedback\, leading to the establishment of a dynamical equ
 ilibrium of the interstellar medium within the disk. I will discuss result
 s for disks at different gas surface densities which e.g. demonstrate that
  the molecular gas mass fraction increases with gas surface density. Moreo
 ver\, I will show that outflows generated by supernovae that explode withi
 n the parental molecular clouds may contain a significant fraction of diff
 use molecular hydrogen that is not well traced by CO. These simulations wi
 ll bring forth a modern paradigm for the full life cycle of molecular clou
 ds with important implications for galaxy evolution.\n\nhttp://www.physik.

SUMMARY:Münchner Physik Kolloquium: Oxide interfaces – a fantastic worl

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Prof. Dr. Jochen Mannhart\n(Max Planck Institute for 
 Solid State Research Stuttgart)\n\nExtraordinary electron systems can be g
 enerated at well-defined interfaces between complex oxides [1]. These two-
 dimensional electron systems are characterized by properties that fundamen
 tally differ from those of two-dimensional electron gases in semiconductor
  heterostructures\, which provide the basis of the Quantum Hall Effect and
  are exploited in high electron mobility transistors.In recent years\, gro
 undbreaking progress has been achieved in exploring and utilizing novel ox
 ide electron systems. In the presentation I will provide an overview of th
 eir surprising properties (see\, e.g.\, [2]) and explore the potential of 
 electron liquids at oxide interfaces for the use in nanoscale electronic d
 evices.\n\nhttp://www.physik.uni-muenchen.de/aus_der_fakultaet/kolloquien/

SUMMARY:Münchner Physik Kolloquium: Spin qubits in GaAs quantum dots – 
 progress towards scalability

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Prof. Dr. Hendrik Bluhm\n(Experimentalphysik und II. 
 Physikalisches Institut\, RWTH Aachen)\n\nThe performance of qubits consis
 ting of electron spins in semiconductors trapped via electrostatic gates h
 as seen dramatic improvements over the last few years. In particular\, the
  measured dephasing times associated with electrical noise and nuclear spi
 n fluctuations were increased by orders of magnitude\, and high fidelity s
 ingle shot readout has been realized. To make further progress\, it is ess
 ential to realize high fidelity gates for single and multiple qubits. One 
 milestone is our recent demonstration and characterization of a two-qubit 
 entangling gate.For single qubit gates\, we find from a numerical optimiza
 tion based on the measured dephasing times and taking realistic constraint
 s into account that fidelities approaching the threshold required for quan
 tum error correction should be achievable. I will conclude with an outlook
  of what is needed beyond these promising results to move further along th
 e path towards scalable semiconductor qubits that are viable for quantum i
 nformation processing.\n\nhttp://www.physik.uni-muenchen.de/aus_der_fakult

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Prof. Dr. Christian Holm\n(Institut für Computerphys
 ik Universität Stuttgart)\n\nIn the last 20 years the importance of soft 
 condensed matter that encompasses polymers\, colloidal solutions\, liquid 
 crystals\, and biological matter\, has steadily increased. A specially imp
 ortant subclass is charged soft matter which includes polyelectrolytes\, p
 roteins\, DNA\, or charged stabilized colloidal solutions that we meet in 
 daily life in soaps\, food\, lipsticks or sanitary products\, just to name
  a few. Soft matter systems are normally large compared to quantum dimensi
 ons\, so that classical effective theories are sufficient to describe thei
 r behavior. However\, thermal motion and conformational entropy plays a la
 rge role and those effects need to be taken accurately into account in the
 ir modeling. Coarse-grained models are very successful to model the static
  behavior of soft matter systems\, however\, one needs to use mesoscopic s
 olvent model to describe dynamical effects. We will present recent develop
 ments to model the electrophoretic behavior of charged polymers and colloi
 ds and discuss the interesting case of DNA within a nanopore.\n\nhttp://ww
