DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Johannes Bauer\, Harvard University\, USA\n\n\nWe pro
 pose a novel realization of Kondo physics with ultracold atomic gases. It 
 is based on a Fermi sea of two different hyperfine states of one atom spec
 ies forming bound states with a different species\, which is spatially con
 fined in a trapping potential. We show that different situations displayin
 g Kondo physics can be realized when Feshbach resonances between the speci
 es are tuned by a magnetic field andthe trapping frequency is varied. We i
 llustrate that a mixture of${}^{40}$K and ${}^{23}$Na atoms can be used to
  generate a Kondo correlated state and that momentum resolved radio freque
 ncy spectroscopy can provide unambiguous signatures of the formation of Ko
 ndo resonances at the Fermi energy. We discuss how tools of atomic physics
  can be used to investigate open questions for Kondo physics\, such as the
  extension of the Kondo screening cloud.\n\nhttp://www.theorie.physik.uni-
