DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Mikhail  Kiselev\, ICTP\, Trieste\n\n\nWe investigate
  the interplay between effects of Zeeman field and strongSpin-Orbit (SO) i
 nteraction in the single electron transistor built on aquantum dot strongl
 y coupled to one of the leads by a single-mode quantumpoint contact. It is
  shown that at the magnetic field smaller compared toeffective field assoc
 iated with the spin-orbit interaction thethermoelectric coefficients depen
 d on an angle between the Zeeman and SOfields allowing a fine-tuning a Fer
 mi-liquid to Non-Fermi-liquid crossoverby the in-plane magnetic field. We 
 discuss how the effects of strongelectron interaction and resonance scatte
 ring influence the thermoelectrictransport through the nano-devices and pr
 esent some suggestions forexperimental verification of our theoretical pre
 dictions.\n\nhttp://www.theorie.physik.uni-muenchen.de/lsschollwoeck/talks

SUMMARY:Solid State Theory Seminar: Many-body localization and entanglemen
 t dynamics

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Jens Bardarson\, MPI Dresden\n\nThe rapidly emerging 
 field of many-body localization is concerned with the fate of the Anderson
  insulator under electron-electron interaction and the characterization of
  the possible resulting many-body localized phase.\n\nIn this talk I will 
 discuss a slow (logarithmic) increase of entanglement after a global quenc
 h deep in the localized phase\, and the use of a local quench and the resu
 lting entanglement dynamics to explore the properties of the delocalizatio
 n transition. In addition I will present numerical data in support of vari
 ous different many-body localized phases\, as discussed phenomenologically
  by Huse et al.\, in particular a spin-glass phase in an Ising model of ma
 ny-body localization.\n\nÂ \n\nhttp://www.theorie.physik.uni-muenchen.de/l
