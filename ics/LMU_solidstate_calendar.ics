DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Johannes Bauer\, Harvard University\, USA\n\n\nWe pro
 pose a novel realization of Kondo physics with ultracold atomic gases. It 
 is based on a Fermi sea of two different hyperfine states of one atom spec
 ies forming bound states with a different species\, which is spatially con
 fined in a trapping potential. We show that different situations displayin
 g Kondo physics can be realized when Feshbach resonances between the speci
 es are tuned by a magnetic field andthe trapping frequency is varied. We i
 llustrate that a mixture of\n\n40\n\nK and\n\n23\n\nNa atoms can be used t
 o generate a Kondo correlated state and that momentum resolved radio frequ
 ency spectroscopy can provide unambiguous signatures of the formation of K
 ondo resonances at the Fermi energy. We discuss how tools of atomic physic
 s can be used to investigate open questions for Kondo physics\, such as th
 e extension of the Kondo screening cloud.\n\nÂ \n\nhttp://www.theorie.phys
