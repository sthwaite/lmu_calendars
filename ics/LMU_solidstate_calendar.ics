 Main\n\n \n\nThe last years have witnessed dramatic progress in experimen
 tal control and refinement of quantum simulations based on ultracold atoms
 . Major recent developments are the realization of synthetic gauge fields 
 for neutral atoms\, allowing the simulation of topologically nontrivial ph
 ases of matter\, and the creation of frustrated lattice geometries such as
  triangular or Kagome. Particularly rich physics arises in the presence of
  multiple atomic species and strong interactions\, which I will highlight 
 for several examples:\n\n1) We propose and theoretically investigate a hyb
 rid system composed of a crystal of trapped ions coupled to a cloud of ult
 racold fermions. The ions form a periodic lattice and induce a band struct
 ure in the atoms. This system combines the advantages of scalability and t
 unability of ultracold atomic systems with the high fidelity operations an
 d detection offered by trapped ion systems. It also features close analogi
 es to natural solid-state systems\, as the atomic degrees of freedom coupl
 e to phonons of the ion lattice\, thereby emulating a solid-state system. 
 Starting from the microscopic many-body Hamiltonian\, we derive the low en
 ergy Hamiltonian including\n\nthe atomic band structure and give an expres
 sion for the atom-phonon coupling. We discuss possible experi-mental imple
 mentations such as a Peierls-like transition into a period-doubled dimeriz
 ed state.\n\n2) We consider a spinful and time-reversal invariant version 
 of the Hofstadter problem which can be realized in ultracold atoms. In the
 se experiments\, an additional staggered potential and spin-orbit coupling
  are available. Without interactions\, the system exhibits various phases 
 such as topological and normal insulator\, metal as well as semi-metal pha
 ses with two or even more Dirac cones. Using a combination of real-space d
 ynamical mean-field theory and analytical techniques\, we discuss the effe
 ct of on-site interactions and determine the corresponding phase diagram. 
 Specifically\, we investigate the stability of topological insulator phase
 s in the presence of strong interactions.\n\n3) We study Bose-Bose mixture
 s on a triangular lattice\, where geometric frustration arises for asymmet
 ric hopping. We map out a rich ground state phase diagram including xy-fer
 romagnetic\, spin-density wave\, superfluid\, and supersolid phases.\n\n
