DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Dr. Peter Bieling\, UC Berkeley\n\n<p>Branched actin 
 networks generate forces required for cell morphogenesis\, motility and or
 ganization of sub-cellular structures. Despite the importance of polymeriz
 ation-mediated force generation in many biological processes\, surprisingl
 y little is known about how dynamic actin networks with physiological arch
 itecture respond to forces at the molecular level. We combined micropatter
 ning with atomic force microscopy and multi-color TIRF imaging to visualiz
 e the force-generating region of growing\, lamellipodial networks in vitro
 . We demonstrate that branched actin networks are highly load-sensitive: N
 etwork velocity decreases exponentially with counteracting forces. However
 \, the actin density increases strongly with elevated loads. Measurement o
 f the force-dependent rate of nucleation demonstrates that enhanced branch
 ing by the Arp2/3 complex is not responsible for increased actin densities
 . Nevertheless\, the concentration of free polymerizing ends rises with th
 e the load force\, an effect that can be explained by the force-dependent 
 decrease in capping. Our AFM-TIRF measurements provide a detailed characte
 rization of the force-dependent changes in actin network assembly. Further
 more\, we have investigated how mechanical properties of branched networks
  respond to external forces. Our results show that the elasticity and mech
 anical resilience of dendritic networks are strongly dependent on the mech
 anical constraints they experience during assembly: Networks grown under h
 igh load are stiffer and more resilient to subsequent mechanical stresses\
 , while networks grown under low force are easily plastically deformed. Th
 is shows that networks permanently adapt to the mechanical environment thr
 ough changes in their architecture.</p>\n\nhttp://www.physik.uni-muenchen.
