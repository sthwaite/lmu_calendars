DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Dr. Peter Bieling\, UC Berkeley\n\n<p>Branched actin 
 networks generate forces required for cell morphogenesis\, motility and or
 ganization of sub-cellular structures. Despite the importance of polymeriz
 ation-mediated force generation in many biological processes\, surprisingl
 y little is known about how dynamic actin networks with physiological arch
 itecture respond to forces at the molecular level. We combined micropatter
 ning with atomic force microscopy and multi-color TIRF imaging to visualiz
 e the force-generating region of growing\, lamellipodial networks in vitro
 . We demonstrate that branched actin networks are highly load-sensitive: N
 etwork velocity decreases exponentially with counteracting forces. However
 \, the actin density increases strongly with elevated loads. Measurement o
 f the force-dependent rate of nucleation demonstrates that enhanced branch
 ing by the Arp2/3 complex is not responsible for increased actin densities
 . Nevertheless\, the concentration of free polymerizing ends rises with th
 e the load force\, an effect that can be explained by the force-dependent 
 decrease in capping. Our AFM-TIRF measurements provide a detailed characte
 rization of the force-dependent changes in actin network assembly. Further
 more\, we have investigated how mechanical properties of branched networks
  respond to external forces. Our results show that the elasticity and mech
 anical resilience of dendritic networks are strongly dependent on the mech
 anical constraints they experience during assembly: Networks grown under h
 igh load are stiffer and more resilient to subsequent mechanical stresses\
 , while networks grown under low force are easily plastically deformed. Th
 is shows that networks permanently adapt to the mechanical environment thr
 ough changes in their architecture.</p>\n\nhttp://www.physik.uni-muenchen.

SUMMARY:CeNS Seminar: The engineering of synthetic biological systems by h
 arnessing functioning principles of natural cells

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Prof. Cheemeng Tan\, University of California Davis\n
 \n<p>Synthetic biology is a multi-disciplinary field\, which integrates un
 derstanding in biology with principles from engineering\, physics\, and ch
 emistry for the design and creation of new biologically-relevant systems. 
 Synthetic biology has made tremendous recent strides in engineering synthe
 tic cellular systems using minimal cell components\, creating an experimen
 tal platform for characterizing the behavior of isolated cellular modules 
 and a form of biotechnology for the controlled operation of synthetic cell
 s. The robustness and efficiency of these systems are nonetheless challeng
 ing to control\, in part because a synthetic gene circuit is often enginee
 red by focusing only on genetic control elements. Here\, I demonstrate how
  non-genetic control elements\, including host growth rates and molecular 
 crowding\, can lead to emergent dynamics of synthetic  biological systems
 . My work has implications for efficient and robust control of both synthe
 tic and natural cellular circuits and underscores the critical need to acc
 ount for non-genetic control elements when engineering gene circuits. In a
 ddition\, my work establishes a foundation towards integrating synthetic c
 ellular components of biological circuits and artificial cells for biotech
 nological applications.</p>\n\nhttp://www.physik.uni-muenchen.de/aus_der_f
